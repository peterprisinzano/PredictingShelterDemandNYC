Time Series Forecasting for Homeless Shelter Demand in NYC

##Meta's Prophet: Open Source Software for Time Series Forecasting
###Prophet is effective in capturing complex patterns in time series data like seasonality, additive/multiplicative trends, and the impact of holidays. In this study, Prophet will be applied to forecast homeless shelter demand in New York City. Holidays such as Christmas, as well as the temperature will be included to create the model. The dataset used was obtained from the DHS and contains weekly records from January 2014 to January 2021, showing the total amount of individuals in shelter as well as the temperature. The goal is to build a forecasting model capable of predicting future demand for these homeless shelters in the future, ideally providing accurate estimates on a monthly and annual basis.
